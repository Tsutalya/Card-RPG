# Card-RPG
A short RPG with a card-based combat system.
Move with WASD.
Click on the Mage (wearing a pink robe) to hear tips about how to play.
Defeat your opponent (red cape) by choosing cards to use against him; some are ranged spells, but others require you to be close to him to attack.
Movement is limited to 5 squares per round, so move carefully!
